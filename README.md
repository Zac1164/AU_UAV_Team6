How to install:
1. Download and install ROS from: ros.org
2. Install Matt Holt's ROS package for testing collision avoidance algorithms with UAS (AU-UAV-ROS) from: https://github.com/holtjma/AU-UAV-ROS
3. Replace the files collisionAvoidance.cpp, evaluator.cpp, and KMLCreator.cpp in the AU-UAV-ROS package with those available on this github
